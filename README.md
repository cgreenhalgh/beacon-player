Quick attempt to prototype i-beacon triggered audio player in Ionic.

initially based on [this plugin](https://github.com/petermetz/cordova-plugin-ibeacon) and [this tutorial](https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2015/09/support-ibeacons-in-your-ionic-framework-mobile-app/)

Current status: nothing here.
